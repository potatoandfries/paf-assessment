We were able to cuddle up in the comfy couch after a day on the beach. We are especially grateful for our experience here because we had to cancel our previous place at the rocks.  The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed  if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem. My poor son was having asthma attacks. Luckily  Cat was able to accommodate last minute and she was sure to deal with any concerns we had right away. But we didn’t have any. Everything was great  you won’t be disappointed."),

("2019-01-08", "1143151", "Sharon", "I'm hoping the point of reviews are to help promote both good hosts & guests; helping others in the future. Please be assured this review isn't in spite of my husband's original booking/cancellation made via (Website hidden by Airbnb) which was cancelled days prior to our reservation due to owner (supposably) overbooking! With flights  baby/dog sitter & tours booked  this caused unnecessary stress. Desperately   l searched airbnb for backup accommodation;  at peak time/short notice. I didn't think l would have much luck. Surprisingly & unknowingly  I had just booked the same unit my hubby was told was unavailable! It became even more apparent when Eleanor asked if I had used another I service as dates/surname were familiar. Through further messaging (address revealed) it was confirmed l had indeed rebooked the same unit! I was honest with Eleanor and expressed my disappointment and the unnecessary stressed she caused for no reason. Eleanor's excuse  in her words "" (Website hidden by Airbnb) seemed dodgy and l 'was going' to contact your husband to book via airbnb but it has worked out well""...Really!? Everything aside  we decided to make the most of it; feeling relieved we had accommodation.  I wasn't going to mention this but after our stay  l feel compelled to continue to provide open & honest feedback. I hope others will do the same; not just about this property but others. I was upfront with Eleanor and will continue to do to so to the end. About our stay...good location - nearby restaurants/transport. When organising check in  Eleanor asked us to collect keys from her residence (which isn't just around the corner - it's over 1km away). We requested for cleaner to handover keys which was greatly appreciated. After cleaner left and our return  we struggled to open the front door with lock sticking and then to enter a hot box! There're only ceiling fans to move the air. In January temps; not ideal. Instructions were left on how to operate fan/lights but we couldn't get both working  but thankfully we only got the fans working. If you're thinking about staying here; make sure it's not during extreme hot/cold weather.Every time the shower is used it leaks on the floor & remains wet 24 hrs!  Thankfully  info was left in book so we weren't alarmed. The view described was misleading.  Yes  you can see the harbour bridge if you 'stand' in the lounge. Windows are high & obscure the view. The balcony also overlooks a car park & derelict units. To see the bridge from here you also need to stand to the top end. The balcony door sticks; concerning with a full pane of glass. An accident waiting to happen. Upon departure   we always empty bins  clean and strip beds. But I was horrified to find yellow stains on the bottom sheet at foot end of the bed..eeew! This really was the straw that broke the camels back! Believe me  we are not picky people  easy going  and all our reviews from other properties/ hosts have been positive. If you want true comfort  functional  a proper view; I definitely do not recommend this unit."),

Generally okay and provided a base and adequate. We did find a number of shortcomings which  from a basic starting point left us disappointed. A bottle of wine and some biscuits were there to welcome us.The place listed a single bed that converted into a king size bed. It doesn't and is more of a child bed. Not great for our adult son who stayed with us. Rather a long list of do & don'ts (don't wear shoes  don't open certain windows  do put on humidifier  do open doors   caution with worktops etc) suggested a higher standard of apartment than  it turned out to be. The cooker and facilities were not brilliant and no seating on the balcony as shown in the photos).While not bad it is basic and we were very put off cooking when we found rotting food in the microwave. No TV unless you have iphone. Can be noisy if windows left open. We paid a high price  accepting it was over New Year  it was not the standard we thought we had booked."),

You cancelled our 1st  booking  apparently there was a problem with your airbnb account.

When requested you price matched the 1st booking. When I requested check-in details I had no response  3 days prior to departure or day before departure. After a 27+hr flight from UK to Sydney we arrived at the airport and went to check the address details and directions and found the email to say the apartment booking had been cancelled. I get the reason  if its true  I understand. But we landed at 9pm with nowhere to stay. Did you personally offer to help us or find us alternative accommodation with you?  A BIG FAT NO! Refund when requested. Next day we attempted to book another apartment with you and you actually declined us  when really you should have been helping us  to find somewhere to stay.That is what shocked me the most  the unhelpfulness. You knew why we wanted to stay  you knew the problems we had had before - none of them our fault and still you refused to help.

Actually it looks it has not been cleaned in a while.There were cockroaches all around the place  mainly in the living room and the kitchen. Bed clothes in the Bedroom were used (you expect clean sheets when you book a place)Sitting in a sofa so dirty is disgusting. And the tv and electronics were not properly connected to use. Everything is full of dust and dirtiness.We had to clean the chairs and table to be able to use them. The add says “breakfast provided” but that was not been arranged.The humidity smell is really bad and it should be a comment in the description warning about that before booking.To sum up  our stay in this place was not pleasant. We came with a lot of expectations to have a good time for new year in Sydney. This is the first time I have a bad experience with Airbnb.My family want to have a good time and don’t want to waste all our days being uncomfortable. They asked me to move to a clean place from the beginning. This was a big problem because booking with no anticipation here  these days is very difficult to find and also is very expensive. I would like to cancel from the first day but we couldn’t find another place until now.I’m claiming for the full refund plus the cleaning fees since this apartment hasn’t been cleaned for receiving us. I also ask for the service fees to compensate this really bad experience. This is the first time I have a bad experience booking a place with Airbnb. I know this is just an isolated case and I trust that the company will resolve my dispute fairly."),

Unfortunately this excitement dwindled on a daily basis. Our initial check in was great and David was most accommodating of us needing to check in earlier than 3pm  which was great. When we arrived  the place was very warm  we saw the air con wasn't actually a proper air con unit  but a mobile one sticking out of the patio doors side window. It appeared quite old as well and did not pump much cool air  further than 2 or 3 metres  so it's understandable why it was warm. There are two fans to help  one downstairs and one in the main bedroom upstairs. I think it should be made clear in regards to this in the listing.  Plus you have to empty the water container (3-5litres) every day yourself. Then we looked around the place and to be honest it's a lot more tired than it looks in the photos. There are cracks and patches on all walls and two holes in the ceiling  which leaked when it rained on the last stay. The kitchen units are also looking tired and some do not shut properly. The shower doesn't work properly  it runs more like a tap due to the shower heads holes all being worn away. I reported this on day 2 of our stay and David offered to replace it but I said we would get by. On reflection I wish I'd insisted on replacing the shower head  because I have since read other reviews and saw that someone in January reported the shower not working as well  so nothing has obviously been done to correct it and may not after my report either. There were hand prints all over the patio doors and on day 3 we had been making our bed and found an empty condom wrapper under the bed. so not great on the cleaning front either. This was also reported and David offered to have the place re cleaned  but with us only having 2 days of our stay left I saw very little point. We pay for cleaning  so you expect that side of things to be done properly. We didn't notice until we left as our suitcases had been placed under the stairs  but when we took them out to leave they were covered in dust. I hope these issues are fixed for the next guests."),

We came to Australia to celebrity our 25 th wedding anniversary  trip of our life!  We were checked in with Steve who was very accommodating and pleasant. He pointed out that the carpet is old but clean. It really does have ripples in it from being so old. I thought  no biggie  we can live with that. Over the course of the first 24 hours of our stay many more red flags surfaced. You cannot turn on the hot water in the kitchen if anyone is using the shower- immediately it goes cold. The oven is weird  no directions on how to use it either. The kitchen floor is not tacked down! Looks lovely in the pictures but it is just splashed down. I walked on it in my bare feet and it came up! Underneath is disgusting!  The carpet in the bedroom has a big burn mark in it  which was covered by a bath mat. The bed is hard  not comfortable at all. There was an air mattress on top of the cabinet in the bedroom but it’s too small for the bed. The couch is good looking but has painful springs poking up in 2 cushions. One odd thing is in the bedroom there are side table on either side of the bed  which is nice. The dresser is tucked into the corner  but the side table makes it impossible to open the bottom drawers of the dresser. Awkward!  The kitchen utensils were disgusting and we had to wash everything before we used it.  The cabinet under the sink is awful as well. We hope this place improves because the location is wonderful."),

The air conditioner was a bit noisy but it worked well. The Murphy bed was very comfortable. There were laundry machines in the building but you needed to pay to use them. Natasha put together a very informative local guide book and she passed along unused transit passes that were left behind by her previous guests. Natasha is a kind and flexible host. She let us check in a bit early and met us at the apartment to explain everything we needed to know. She responded promptly to all messaging.My only criticism of Natasha's place is that it was on the ground floor right beside a very busy sidewalk. The only window faced the sidewalk  which afforded absolutely no privacy if the curtains were left open. This is just simply the design of the apartment  not much that can be done. However  if you can find reasonably priced accommodation  that faces the ocean or is on a higher floor it may be worth spending the extra money for the scenic views and added privacy."),

You have your own room with your own front door. However  to get to your bathroom you need to use the hall the family also uses. There is a six-foot high partition in the hall but of course you can be heard/can hear when entering the bathroom etc.. Also not having a sink in your room can be a little awkward - although Michele offers to do your dishes if you send her an e-mail and leave the stuff by the partition. It's kind of like sharing a flat without talking to each other but hearing there is someone next door.
